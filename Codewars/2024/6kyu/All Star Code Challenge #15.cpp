/* 
 * Task:
 * The scroller works by replacing the current text string with a similar text string, but with the first letter shifted to the end; this simulates movement.
 * Your father is far too busy with the business to worry about such details, so, naturally, he's making you come up with the text strings.
 * Create a function named rotate() that accepts a string argument and returns an array of strings with each letter from the input string being rotated to the end.
 *
 * Example:
 * rotate("Hello") // => {"elloH", "lloHe", "loHel", "oHell", "Hello"}
 *
 * Notes:
 * The original string should be included in the output array. 
 * The order matters. Each element of the output array should be the rotated version of the previous element. 
 * The output array SHOULD be the same length as the input string. 
 * The function should return an empty array with a 0 length string, '', as input.
