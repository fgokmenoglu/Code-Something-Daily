/*
 * Remember the triangle of balls in billiards? To build a classic triangle (5 levels) you need 15 balls. With 3 balls you can build a 2-level triangle, etc.
 *
 * For more examples,
 * pyramid(1) == 1
 * pyramid(3) == 2
 * pyramid(6) == 3
 * pyramid(10) == 4
 * pyramid(15) == 5
 *
 * Write a function that takes number of balls (â‰¥ 1) and calculates how many levels you can build a triangle.
