/*
 * INTRODUCTION
 * In C++, you can compare values using the comparison operators: <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=
 * The result of these comparisons is always a boolean value.
 * This kind of comparison is available for numbers and strings. 
 * When comparing strings, the dictionary order (also known as lexicographic order) is followed.
 *
 * NOTES
 * Since C++17 if-statements can also include a short initialization statement that can be used to initialize one or more variables for the if statement.
 * Any variables created in the initialization cannot be accessed after the end of the if statement.
 * Example:
 * int num{7};
 *
 * if (int v{2 * num}; v > 10) {
 *   return v;
 * } else {
 *   return num;
 * }
