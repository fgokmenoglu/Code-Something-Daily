"""
Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.

It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b keeping their order.

array_diff([1,2],[1]) == [2]
If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:

array_diff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3]
"""
def array_diff(a, b):
    #your code here
    for element_b in b:
        a = [element_a for element_a in a if element_a != element_b]
        
    return a

    # Alternative
    # b_set = set(b)

    # return [item for item in a if item not in b_set]
